# Collection of thesis code

Currently uploaded is my code used for simulations. Both the fempy and dune-fem version.
Error functionality is not included in the uploaded version.
  
In the fem-py  code we include some options.
The included deformation functions are for a ball and a biconcave disc.
The parameters can be edited within the file. 
The graphical output can be changed or removed depending on the parameter value given.
