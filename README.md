# Collection of thesis code

unsure at this time how much code I will upload.
Currently uploaded is my code used for simulations. Both the fempy and dune-fem version.
Error functionality is not included in the uploaded version.
No plans exist to upload dgf files.

During my thesis I implemented some other problems. These are not relevant to my thesis and I am currently undecided if to upload. Such schemes include
  mean curvature flow
      using standard method, BGN or Elliot-Fritz.
  ALE SFEM with full coupling
